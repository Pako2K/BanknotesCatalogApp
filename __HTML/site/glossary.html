        <ul>
            <li>Currency</li>
            <p>In this catalogue, currency defines the system of monetary units in common use by people in a nation, region or territory.</p>
            <p>Currencies are usually defined by a central or local government, and the corresponding banknotes (or coins) are issued by authorized entities, like a central bank.</p>
            <p>Each currency has a value and can be traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies.</p>
            <p>Some times a currency will be <i>re-valued</i> or <i>re-denominated</i>. Even if the name of the currency stays the same, this will considered a currency change.</p>
            <p>It is also possible that a currency name is changed. This is not leading to a new currency if the change only implies removing or adding a qualifier (like "New", "Golden", etc.)</p>
            <li>Issue Date</li>
            <p>The year in which the banknote variant was issues for the first time. In case it is not known, the printed date year will be used.</p>
            <li>Printed Date</li>
            <p>The date shown on the banknote variant. It can differ from the issue date.</p>
            <li>Denomination</li>
            <p>Is the actual value of the banknote, in the corresponding currency units.</p>
            <li>Note type</li>
            <p>Banknotes with the same denomination and belonging to the same issue define a "Note type".</p>
            <li>Face Value</li>
            <p>Is the value of the banknote, in the corresponding currency (sub or super) units provided on the banknote itself.</p>
            <li>Issue</li>
            <p>Is a semi-arbitrary grouping of one or more denominations with a common design and or similar date of issue.</p>
            <p>An "issue" should not include 2 banknotes with the same denomination and a different design.</p>
            <p>Only variations of the same denomination banknote are allowed in the same Issue.</p>
            <p>Exception: so called provisional/emergency issues which often include overstamped notes of different issues, which might belong to a different currency or country.</p>
